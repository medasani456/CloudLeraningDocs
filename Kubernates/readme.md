# CloudLearning Documentation ☁️
Welcome to my Cloud Learning repository! This project serves as a centralized hub for my notes, configurations, and hands-on labs as I navigate the world of containerization and orchestration.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The documentation is organized into two primary sections:

Docker: Basics of containerization, image building, Dockerfiles, and networking.

Kubernetes: Cluster management, Pods, Services, Deployments, and Helm charts.

## 🐋 Docker
Focuses on the fundamentals of building, running, and managing containers.

Key Concepts: Images vs. Containers, Volumes, Docker Compose.

Goal: Learn to package applications that run consistently anywhere.

## ☸️ Kubernetes (K8s)
Focuses on orchestrating containers at scale.

Key Concepts: Control Plane, Worker Nodes, YAML manifests, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

Goal: Automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CloudLearning.git
Navigate to a topic:
Choose between the /Docker or /Kubernetes folders to find specific notes.md or sample configuration files.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine for Linux)

kubectl (Kubernetes command-line tool)

Minikube or Kind (for local K8s testing)
