# CloudLearning Documentation ☁️

Welcome to my Cloud Learning repository! This project serves as a centralized hub for my notes, configurations, and hands-on labs as I navigate the world of containerization and orchestration.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The documentation is organized into two primary sections:

* **[Docker](https://www.google.com/search?q=./Docker)**: Basics of containerization, image building, Dockerfiles, and networking.
* **[Kubernetes](https://www.google.com/search?q=./Kubernetes)**: Cluster management, Pods, Services, Deployments, and Helm charts.

---

## 🐋 Docker

Focuses on the fundamentals of building, running, and managing containers.

* **Key Concepts:** Images vs. Containers, Volumes, Docker Compose.
* **Goal:** Learn to package applications that run consistently anywhere.

## ☸️ Kubernetes (K8s)

Focuses on orchestrating containers at scale.

* **Key Concepts:** Control Plane, Worker Nodes, YAML manifests, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
* **Goal:** Automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CloudLearning.git

```


2. **Navigate to a topic:**
Choose between the `/Docker` or `/Kubernetes` folders to find specific `notes.md` or sample configuration files.

## 🛠️ Requirements

* **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine for Linux)
* **kubectl** (Kubernetes command-line tool)
* **Minikube** or **Kind** (for local K8s testing)

Would you like me to generate a specific `notes.md` template for one of those folders to help you start documenting your first lab?
